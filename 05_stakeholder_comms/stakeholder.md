# Communicate with Stakeholders
Notes: I took the approach to draft an email to a Chief Product Officer based on preference and comfort. Alternatives would have been a Chief Financial Officer or Chief Operations Officer.


**Subject: Fetch Rewards Data Analysis - Initial Findings & Next Steps**

Hi [Chief Product Officer],  

We have completed the initial analysis of our receipts, users, and brands data as part of building our new Rewards data mart. We wanted to share some key findings and get your guidance on a few strategic questions that will help us deliver maximum value from this data asset.

## Key Questions We Need Your Help With
**1. Stakeholder Alignment**
As we scale this analytics platform, I'd like to understand your vision for how different teams should interact with this data. Should Marketing have direct access for campaign analysis? Does Finance need revenue dashboards from all LOBs? Do we have a defined set of OKRs that the data product team can align to? Understanding these use cases will help us prioritize the right data models and access patterns.

**2. User Identity Strategy** 
We have discovered some inconsistencies in our user ID system during data processing. Before we build CLV models or personalization features, our team need to connect with whoever owns our user identity management. Do you know if this sits with Engineering, Product, or Customer Success?

**3. Data Enrichment Opportunities**
Our current dataset is rich but could be even more powerful with additional context. Are there other systems we should be integrating - perhaps customer service tickets, marketing campaign data, or inventory systems? This would help us build more comprehensive customer journey analytics.

**4. Performance & Investment Planning**
Looking ahead, if we're processing thousands of receipts daily and supporting real-time dashboards for multiple teams, we'll need to ensure our infrastructure can scale. We have a plan for this using database optimization best practices, but we wanted to check: what's our appetite for cloud infrastructure investment to support advanced analytics capabilities?

## Data Quality Insights
During the modeling process, We identified a few data quality patterns worth noting:
- **99.7% data integrity** across our core datasets (excellent baseline)
- **Minor JSON parsing issues** in 2 records (easily fixable)
- **Geographic data gaps** in ~15% of user records (may impact regional analysis)

These issues are typical for a growing platform and none are blockers for immediate analytics. However, addressing them will improve our confidence in customer segmentation and geographic analytics.

## Immediate Value & Next Steps
The analytics foundation is ready to start delivering insights. We can begin supporting business questions around customer behavior, product performance, and seasonal trends immediately.

For next quarter, Our recommendation is that we focus on:
1. **Stakeholder onboarding** - training teams on self-service analytics
2. **Data quality monitoring** - automated alerts for anomalies  
3. **Advanced analytics** - predictive models for customer lifetime value

Would love to discuss this further - happy to demo the current capabilities or dive deeper into any of these topics. 

When would be a good time to connect?

Thanks!  
Barrett Podpechan
