# Fetch Data Products Take Home Assessment Repository
This repository is in service towards the technical assessment demonstrating data modeling, SQL proficiency, and data quality analysis skills. 
This project contains files that will unstructured JSON data into a structured relational data model, answer business questions through SQL queries, 
and identify data quality issues within the available data.

## Key Components:
* PostgreSQL database file (found here)
* Relational database design and ERD modeling files (found here)
* SQL queries used to answer the questions found deeper in this README (found here)
* SQL queries used to assess data quality (found here)
* Example stakeholder communication for technical findings (found here)

## Write queries that directly answer predetermined questions from a business stakeholder:
* What are the top 5 brands by receipts scanned for most recent month?
* How does the ranking of the top 5 brands by receipts scanned for the recent month compare to the ranking for the previous month?
* When considering average spend from receipts with 'rewardsReceiptStatus’ of ‘Accepted’ or ‘Rejected’, which is greater?
* When considering total number of items purchased from receipts with 'rewardsReceiptStatus’ of ‘Accepted’ or ‘Rejected’, which is greater?
* Which brand has the most spend among users who were created within the past 6 months?
* Which brand has the most transactions among users who were created within the past 6 months?
  
## Communicate with Stakeholders
* What questions do you have about the data?
* How did you discover the data quality issues?
* What do you need to know to resolve the data quality issues?
* What other information would you need to help you optimize the data assets you're trying to create?
* What performance and scaling concerns do you anticipate in production and how do you plan to address them?
